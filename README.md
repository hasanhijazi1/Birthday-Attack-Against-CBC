# Switching Between Brute Force and Optimized Attack
By default, the attack implementation in attack.c uses a hash-table based algorithm to reduce memory usage and support large inputs efficiently.

A brute-force O(nÂ²) version is also implemented (but commented )
To try the brute-force attack:
    Comment the hash-based version
    Uncomment the nested-loop brute-force version:
